Sorting a List of Items with Quicksort
At the heart of quicksort is the notion of partitioning the list with respect to one of
 the values called a pivot. For
example, suppose we are given the following list to be sorted:

53 12 98 63 18 32 80 46 72 21

We can partition it with respect to the first value, 53. This means placing 53 in such
 a position that all values to the left of it are smaller and all values to the right 
are greater than or equal to it. Shortly, we will describe an algorithm
that will partition num as follows:

21 12 18 32 46 53 80 98 72 63 

The value 53 is used as the pivot. It is placed in position 6. All values to the left
 of 53 are smaller than 53, and all values to the right are greater. 
The location in which the pivot is placed is called the division point (dp, say). By
definition, 53 is in its final sorted position.
If we can sort num[1..dp-1] and num[dp+1..n], we would have sorted the entire list. But we can use the same
process to sort these pieces, indicating that a recursive procedure is appropriate.
