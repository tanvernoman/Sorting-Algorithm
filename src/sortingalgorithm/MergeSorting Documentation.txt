Merge sorting: By Recursion

sort list
	sort first half of the list
	sort second half of the list
	merge sorted halves into one sorted list 
end sort;

sort (first half of list)
	sort first half of (first half of list) //one quarter of the original list
	sort second half of (first half of list) //one quarter of the original list
	merge sorted halves into one sorted list
end sort

We can modify our algorithm as follows:
sort a list
if the list contains more than one element then
	sort first half of list
	sort second half of list
	merge sorted halves into one sorted list
end if
end sort
