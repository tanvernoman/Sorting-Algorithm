Bubble Sort:
sort works by comparing neighbouring data items in an array, and if the two items 
are not sorted relative to each other, the two items are exchanged.

Consider the following representation of data in an array. It is not in any sorted 
order, and we wish to sort the data so that the higher values are to the left and the
 lower values are to the right. We use the convention that the leftmost array element is 
element zero, and the index increases by one as we move to the right.

The first step of the process is to compare the contents of element [0] with the 
contents of element [1]. If element [0] is less than element [1] the two items are 
unsorted relative to each other, and they must be exchanged. In this case the two 
 
8 2 6 7 9 
elements are already in order, and should not be exchanged.

The description above is of course only valid for the data given above. In more general terms the process can be described thus:


while()
{
   for number of elements - 1
   {
      compare adjacent elements
      if elements out of order then exchange elements or swap
   }
}
